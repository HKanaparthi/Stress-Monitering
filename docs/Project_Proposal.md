# Student Stress Monitor: AI-Powered Mental Health Assessment System
## Project Proposal

---

## Project Title
**Student Stress Monitor: Intelligent Mental Health Assessment and Recommendation System**

---

## Intended Use of the System

### Target Users
The primary target users are **college and university students aged 18-25** who are experiencing academic pressure, social challenges, and life transitions. Secondary users include **academic counselors, mental health professionals, and student support services** who can utilize the system's insights to better understand student wellness trends.

### Real-World Context
Students will interact with the system in various contexts:
- **Personal Assessment**: During periods of high stress (exam weeks, major assignments, life changes)
- **Routine Monitoring**: As part of regular mental health check-ins and self-awareness practices
- **Crisis Prevention**: Early detection of escalating stress levels before they become overwhelming
- **Academic Support**: Integration with campus wellness programs and counseling services

The system operates as a web-based application accessible from any device, allowing students to perform assessments privately in dormitories, libraries, or counseling centers.

### Intelligent Capabilities Supporting User Tasks
The AI system enhances traditional stress assessment methods by:
- **Automated Pattern Recognition**: Identifying subtle correlations between lifestyle factors and stress levels
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Providing individualized stress predictions based on multi-dimensional analysis
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Generating contextual advice tailored to specific stress patterns and user profiles
- **Predictive Analytics**: Early warning systems for potential mental health crises
- **Continuous Learning**: Improving accuracy through user feedback and outcome tracking

## Overall Functionality

### Problem Statement
Traditional mental health assessments rely heavily on subjective self-reporting and clinical expertise, often resulting in delayed intervention and generic treatment approaches. Students frequently struggle to recognize stress patterns or access timely mental health support, leading to academic performance decline, social isolation, and potential long-term psychological impacts.

### Core Functions and AI Techniques

#### 1. **Multi-Dimensional Stress Classification** (Machine Learning)
- **Technique**: Supervised learning using Random Forest classification
- **Function**: Analyzes 20 lifestyle and psychological factors to predict stress levels (Low/Moderate/High Risk)
- **AI Advantage**: Processes complex, non-linear relationships between variables that human assessment might miss

#### 2. **Feature Importance Analysis** (Knowledge Discovery)
- **Technique**: Tree-based feature importance ranking and correlation analysis
- **Function**: Identifies primary stress contributors for individual users
- **AI Advantage**: Reveals hidden patterns and prioritizes intervention areas

#### 3. **Adaptive Recommendation Engine** (Rule-Based Reasoning)
- **Technique**: Expert system with conditional logic and user profiling
- **Function**: Generates personalized coping strategies and resource recommendations
- **AI Advantage**: Scales expert knowledge and provides 24/7 accessible guidance

#### 4. **Uncertainty Quantification** (Probabilistic Reasoning)
- **Technique**: Confidence scoring and prediction uncertainty estimation
- **Function**: Provides reliability metrics for stress level predictions
- **AI Advantage**: Enables informed decision-making and appropriate escalation protocols
